      ClawGPT connects to local OpenClaw gateways on LAN IPs (ws://).
      Android's network_security_config doesn't support IP range matching,
      so we allow cleartext globally but enforce HTTPS at the app level
      for non-local connections (relay uses wss://, all CDN resources use https://).
